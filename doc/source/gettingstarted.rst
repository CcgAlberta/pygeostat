Getting Started
=======

An introduction example for new pygeostat users is provided :ref:`Introduction <examples>`

This introduction assumes familiarity with standard scientific computing packages in Python:

* pandas for data management (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/10min.html)
* numpy for mathematics (https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)
* matplotlib.pyplot for plotting (https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)
Pygeostat users are encouraged to read the linked introductions to theses packages if unfamiliar with them, as pygeostat builds on their functionality.
